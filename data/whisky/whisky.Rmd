86 malt whiskies are scored between 0-4 for 12 different taste categories including sweetness, smoky, nutty etc. Additionally, coordinates of distilleries allow us to obtain pairwise distance information. Using a combination of these datasets it is possible to look for correlations between particular attributes of taste and physical location, for example does a shared local resource have a significant effect on nearby whiskies. By using correlation data it may be possible to provide whisky reccomendations based upon an individual's particular preferences.
